            <h1>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned:<br> were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I<br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>
            <p class="text">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a<br>transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for<br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                shortly thereafter. The next 12<br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve<br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

            <h1>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp<br> themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from<br> their experiences was easy.
            </h1>
            <p class="text"> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The<br> program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br>myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is
                above the rest. You will get the<br> personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

            <h1>Such a life-changing<br> experience. Highly<br> recommended!</h1>
            <p class="text">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br> never written a line of code. I needed<br> some structure from professionals<br> who can help me learn programming<br> step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former student of theirs<br> who
                can only say wonderful things
                <br> about the program. The entire <br>curriculum and staff did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for<br> assistance. The agile team project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my
                learning to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial could ever have. In<br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my<br> developent experience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>developer
                after receiving multiple<br> offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
